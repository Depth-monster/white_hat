### Binaries 
This term refers to files that can be executed, similar to
executables in Windows. Binaries generally reside in the /usr/bin or
usr/sbin directory and include utilities such as ps, cat, ls, and ifconfig
(weâ€™ll touch on all of four of these in this chapter) as well as applications such as the wireless hacking tool aircrack-ng and the intrusion
detection system (IDS) Snort.

### Case sensitivity 

Unlike Windows, the Linux filesystem is case sensitive. This means that Desktop is different from desktop, which is different
from DeskTop.

### Directory 
This is the same as a folder in Windows. A directory provides a way of organizing files, usually in a hierarchical manner
### Home 
Each user has their own /home directory, and this is generally
where files you create will be saved by default.
### Kali 
Kali Linux is a distribution of Linux specifically designed for
penetration testing
### root 
Like nearly every operating system, Linux has an administrator
or superuser account, designed for use by a trusted person who can do
nearly anything on the system. This would include such things as reconfiguring the system, adding users, and changing passwords. In Linux,
that account is called root. As a hacker or pentester, you will often use
the root account to give yourself control over the system. In fact, many
hacker tools require that you use the root account.
