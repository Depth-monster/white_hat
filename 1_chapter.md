### Binaries 
This term refers to files that can be executed, similar to
executables in Windows. Binaries generally reside in the /usr/bin or
usr/sbin directory and include utilities such as ps, cat, ls, and ifconfig
(weâ€™ll touch on all of four of these in this chapter) as well as applications such as the wireless hacking tool aircrack-ng and the intrusion
detection system (IDS) Snort.

### Case sensitivity 
Unlike Windows, the Linux filesystem is case sensitive. This means that Desktop is different from desktop, which is different
from DeskTop.
